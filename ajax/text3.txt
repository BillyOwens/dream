Autumn

Seasonal foods to fill up on in autumn include apples, carrots, kale and onions.
Get the slow cooker out. Just chop up some veggies and meat, leave ‘em in the slow cooker while you are out at school or work and come home to a beautiful ready-made meal.
Try out some wild berries – they are in season at this time of year and can be used for yummy crumbles or custards.
