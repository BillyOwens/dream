Winter

Seasonal foods to fill up on in winter include cabbage, potatoes, leeks and turnips.
It is important to eat well in general, but specifically when you are exercising outdoors, as proper nutrition keeps the body temperature up. So, it is important to eat plenty of starchy carbohydrates, lean proteins and good fats. Base your meals around whole foods instead of processed foods such as ready meals or tinned sauces.
You may not feel as thirsty in the winter as you do in the summer, but it is very important that you drink up, as you will lose fluid when you exercise.
It may be obvious, but try and stick to warm foods. Your probably won’t crave cold foods in winter anyway, so load up on soups, chillis, potatoes and stews before you exercise. Don’t eat a full meal before you set out though or you may end up feeling uncomfortable. A meal one to two hours before you set off is ideal.
Bring some food with you when you exercise outdoors such as cheese or fruit.
