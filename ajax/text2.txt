Summer

Seasonal foods to full up on in summer include beetroot, broccoli, cauliflower, marrows and strawberries.
Most people prefer lighter foods at this time of the year, such as stir fries and salads. Fresh fruit is also quite the tasty treat in summer.
Make sure to drink up – fill up on water and milk rather than sugary juices and fizzy drinks though. Milk and water are more nutritious and won’t damage your teeth at the same time.
